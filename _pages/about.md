Hi, I am **Jiaxuan Zou (邹嘉轩)**.

I am currently an undergraduate student at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, and a research intern at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (Renmin University of China), advised by [Prof. Yong Liu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/liuyong).

I work on mechanistic understanding and interpretability of deep learning. My approach is phenomenon-driven: start from empirical behaviors, then build first-principles mechanisms that explain *why* a model works (or fails) and *where* certain behaviors come from.

# Research Interests

- Mechanistic interpretability of LLMs
- Deep learning theory & optimization
