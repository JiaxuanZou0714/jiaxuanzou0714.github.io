{: .notice--info}
**Currently:** Undergraduate at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University; research intern at Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence (Renmin University of China), advised by Prof. [Yong Liu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/liuyong).

I work on mechanistic understanding and interpretability of deep learning. My approach is phenomenon-driven: start from empirical behaviors, then build first-principles mechanisms that explain *why* a model works (or fails) and *where* certain behaviors come from.

## Research Interests

- Mechanistic interpretability of LLMs
- Deep learning theory & optimization
- AI for scientific discovery and scientific modeling


## Research Experience

### Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China

*Research Intern (Advised by Prof. [Yong Liu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/liuyong))* | *Jun. 2025 – Present*

- Investigate latent reasoning mechanisms in LLMs through mechanistic interpretability.
- Develop a theoretical framework for the exploration–execution trade-off in Latent Chain-of-Thought.
- Propose **Symbolic Index**, a metric measuring decisional certainty during reasoning.
- Prove the necessity of curriculum learning for stable training in this setting.
- Submit the resulting work to *ICLR*.

### School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University

*Undergraduate Researcher (Advised by Prof. [Naihao Liu](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/naihao_liu))* | *2024 – Present*

- Build a channel-independent multi-scale framework for seismic horizon picking with extremely limited labeled data; submitted to *Geophysics*.
- Design a Mamba-based (State Space Model) U-Net for automatic seismic interpretation, improving feature fusion and long-range dependency modeling; to appear in *IEEE TGRS*.
