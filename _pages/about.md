**Research Intern**  
*[Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/)*  
*June 2025 ‚Äì Present*  
Studying latent reasoning in large language models and its mechanistic interpretability. Developed a theoretical framework characterizing the exploration‚Äìexecution trade-off in Latent Chain-of-Thought, introduced the Symbolic Index as a measure of decisional certainty, and proved the necessity of curriculum learning for stable training; manuscript under review at *ICLR*.

**Undergraduate Researcher**  
*[School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi‚Äôan Jiaotong University](https://math.xjtu.edu.cn/)*  
*2024 ‚Äì Present*  
Researching seismic horizon picking under extremely limited labeled data using a channel-independent multi-scale framework; manuscript under review at *Geophysics*.  
Researching automatic seismic interpretation with Mamba-based U-Net architectures; manuscript under review at *IEEE TGRS*.
