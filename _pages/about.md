### Main Research Experience

**Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China**
*Research Intern* | *Jun. 2025 – Present*
*   Investigated latent reasoning mechanisms in large language models through the lens of mechanistic interpretability.
*   Developed a theoretical framework to characterize the exploration-execution trade-off in Latent Chain-of-Thought.
*   Proposed the Symbolic Index, a novel metric to measure the model's decisional certainty during reasoning.
*   Proved the necessity of curriculum learning for achieving stable training in this context.
*   *Work resulting from this research is currently under review at **ICLR**.*

**School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi’an Jiaotong University**
*Undergraduate Researcher* | *2024 – Present*
*   Developed a channel-independent multi-scale framework for seismic horizon picking, specifically designed to perform effectively with extremely limited labeled data. *Manuscript under review at **Geophysics**.*
*   Designed and implemented a novel U-Net architecture based on Mamba (a State Space Model) for automatic seismic interpretation, focusing on improving feature fusion and long-range dependency modeling. *Manuscript under review at **IEEE TGRS**.*
