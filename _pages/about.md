👋Hi! I am Jiaxuan Zou(邹嘉轩), currently an undergraduate student at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Xi'an Jiaotong University. My research interests focus on several areas of artificial intelligence and its applications.

Research Interests🔍
=====
- **Deep learning theory**: I'm interested in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of deep learning models and how they learn and represent information.


- **Mechanistic Interpretability for LLM**: I study the inner workings of large language models, including attention mechanisms, emergent abilities, and interpretability.


- **AI for science**: I'm interested in how AI can accelerate scientific discovery and solve complex problems in various domains.


- **Time series modeling using deep learning approaches**: I research deep learning methods for time series data modeling, exploring how neural networks can effectively capture temporal patterns and dependencies in sequential data.
