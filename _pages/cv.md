Education
======
* B.S. in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Sep 2024–present  

Research Experience
======
* **Low-Frequency Spectral Bias of Neural Networks in Time-Series Forecasting**  
  Sep 2024–Feb 2025 | Adviser: Prof. Xuan Sun, Xi’an Jiaotong University  
  – Provided the first mathematical proof of the “low-frequency-first” phenomenon in neural nets.  
  – Introduced FreLE, an algorithm that explicitly/implicitly regularizes frequency components; achieves SOTA on ETT & Weather datasets.  
  – Paper submitted to KDD 2025 (CCF-A).

* **Deep-Learning-Based Seismic Horizon Picking**  
  Feb 2025–Apr 2025 | Adviser: Prof. Naihao Liu, Xi’an Jiaotong University  
  – Identified poor generalization in small-sample seismic-horizon picking.  
  – Designed Channel-Independent Multi-Scale UNet (CIMS-UNet): multi-cycle embeddings, multi-resolution kernels, channel-independent training.  
  – Leads SOTA on IoU, F1 and noise-robustness; 2 papers (1st-author & co-author) submitted to IEEE TGRS (SCI Q1).

* **Deep Learning for 3-D Molecular Structure Reconstruction from EM Images**  
  Feb 2025– Aug 2025 | Collaborating with Prof. Lei Zhang, Xi’an Jiaotong University  
  – In charge of denoising: BM3D, improved Noise2Noise & Noise2Self pipelines; boosts downstream 3-D reconstruction quality.
