Autobiography

I study mathematics and artificial intelligence as an undergraduate at Xi'an Jiaotong University and currently work as a research intern at the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China.

My path into research has been guided by curiosity for learning systems and optimization. I enjoy building clean implementations, writing, and sharing ideas that make complex topics accessible.

Highlights that shaped my journey include collaborative projects, independent reading, and hands-on experimentation. I value clarity, reproducibility, and rigorous thinking.

Looking ahead, I aim to deepen my understanding of machine learning theory and develop practical methods that solve real problems. Outside work, I read widely and build useful tools.
