While many researchers have observed neural networks’ spectral bias—models fitting low-frequency signals first—this has often been wrongly attributed to specific architectures rather than recognized as a universal trait. To clarify this, we conducted extensive empirical experiments on mainstream models, finding nearly all exhibit spectral bias. To mitigate its impact, we proposed the FreLE algorithm, which improves model generalization via explicit and implicit frequency regularization, and numerous experiments confirm its excellent performance.
