We will start from experimental phenomena to explore the problems that occur when networks deepen, and naturally introduce a new network structure - residual connections. Then we will provide several different perspectives to understand why "residual connections" can succeed, why it is said that it has made today's deep learning flourish, including forward information flow, backward information flow, dynamical systems, and other perspectives.
