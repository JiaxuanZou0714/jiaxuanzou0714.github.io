excerpt: 'We demonstrate that spectral bias—the tendency of neural networks to fit low-frequency signals first—is a universal trait in time-series prediction, not an architectural artifact. To mitigate this, we propose FreLE, an algorithm using frequency regularization to improve model generalization. Extensive experiments confirm FreLE''s effectiveness.'

We demonstrate that spectral bias—the tendency of neural networks to fit low-frequency signals first—is a universal trait in time-series prediction, not an architectural artifact. To mitigate this, we propose FreLE, an algorithm using frequency regularization to improve model generalization. Extensive experiments confirm FreLE's effectiveness.
