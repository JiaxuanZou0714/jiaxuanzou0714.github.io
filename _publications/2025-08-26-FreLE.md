excerpt: 'We demonstrate that spectral bias—the tendency of neural networks to fit low-frequency signals first—is a universal trait in time-series prediction, not an architectural artifact. To mitigate this, we propose FreLE, an algorithm using frequency regularization to improve model generalization. Extensive experiments confirm FreLE''s effectiveness.'

The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models. Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both explicit and implicit frequency regularization. A large number of experiments have proven the superior performance of FreLE
