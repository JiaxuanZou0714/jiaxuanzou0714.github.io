title: "FreIE Low-Frequency Spectral Bias in Neural Networks for Time-Series Tasks"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-08-26-FreLE
excerpt: 'The inherent autocorrelation of time series data challenges multivariate time series prediction, and incorporating frequency domain information is a common approach for long-term prediction. While many researchers have observed neural networks’ spectral bias—models fitting low-frequency signals first—this has often been wrongly attributed to specific architectures rather than recognized as a universal trait. To clarify this, we conducted extensive empirical experiments on mainstream models, finding nearly all exhibit spectral bias. To mitigate its impact, we proposed the FreLE algorithm, which improves model generalization via explicit and implicit frequency regularization, and numerous experiments confirm its excellent performance.'
